# What This Is

This presentation is served as a gatsby site using slides generated from Markdown (mdx specifically).

Sites using `gatsby-theme-slidedeck` can add a `.deck.mdx` file to the `decks` directory such as the following, with the string `gatby-slide` on its own line to separate slides:

```md
<!-- decks/my-fancy-presentation.deck.mdx -->
# What I have to say and why I say it

1. acquire cats
2. acquire neckties
3. put neckties on the cats
4. profit

gatsby-slide (or any slide delimeter you configure)

# This is on a new slide

Look at me!
```

gatsby-slide

# Getting Started

Create a new gatsby site using the `gatsby-starter-slidedeck-theme` starter:

```sh
gatsby new my-slidedeck-site https://github.com/FLGMwt/gatsby-starter-slidedeck-theme
cd my-slidedeck-site
npm run develop # or yarn develop
```

## What's Inside?

When you use the `gatsby-starter-slidedeck-theme` starter, you'll end up with a:

- gastby side configured to use `gatsby-theme-slidedeck`
- `decks` directory with a starter slide deck

That's it! You can edit the template slide deck or create decks of your own.

# What Can I Change?

Since `gatsby-theme-slidedeck` is a [Gatsby Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/), sites that use it have the power to customize almost everything.

For example, if you don't want the slide header to appear, [shadow](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/) it by creating a overriding component in your project that renders nothing:

```jsx
// src/gatsby-theme-slidedeck/componets/slideHeader.js
export default () => null;
```

# How Does It Work?

This theme is influenced by `gatsby-theme-blog` which leverages `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to generate pages from mdx.

Instead of creating pages for each .mdx file, `gatsby-theme-slidedeck` intercepts mdx file nodes as they're created, splits their content on the slide delimeter ('gatsby-slide` by default), then creates new file nodes slide.

The `gatsby-mdx-plugin` picks these up to render the markdown into markup, which we then create pages from.
