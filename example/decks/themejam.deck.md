# What this is

This presentation is served as a gatsby site using slides generated from Markdown (mdx specifically).

Sites using `gatsby-theme-deck` can add a `.deck.mdx` file to the `decks` directory such as the following, with the string `gatby-slide` on its own line to separate slides:

```md
<!-- decks/my-fancy-presentation.deck.mdx -->
# What I have to say and why I say it

1. acquire cats
2. acquire neckties
3. put neckties on the cats
4. profit

gatsby-slide (or any slide delimeter you configure)

# This is on a new slide

Look at me!
```
